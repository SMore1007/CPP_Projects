### What is C++?

C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs as an extension to the C language. It combines the features of procedural programming (like C) and object-oriented programming (OOP).
 
## Key Features:

    Fast and Efficient (close to hardware)

    Object-Oriented (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)

    Rich Standard Library (STL â€“ vectors, maps, etc.)

    Portable (runs on many platforms)

    Supports both high-level and low-level programming
